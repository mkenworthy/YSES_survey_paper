# The Young Suns Exoplanet Survey (YSES)

M. Kenworthy, C. Ginski, A. Bohn, E. Mamajek, several other people.

The Young Suns Exoplanet Survey is a survey of 72 stars with masses similar to that of our Sun, located in the Sco Cen OB association. It is a direct imaging survey to look for self-luminous gas giant exoplanets at distances of up to several hundred astronomical units from their stars.

We use Reference Differential Imaging combined with Principal Component Analysis to minimise noise from the stellar halo, and use a snapshot strategy where 5 minute integrations in two separate filters form the basic observational block.

We have detected three exoplanets in two stellar systems, and one new circumstellar disk and several brown dwarf companions.
